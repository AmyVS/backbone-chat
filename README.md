# Pacman Chat

This was an exercise getting to know the basics of Backbone.js. It's a simple chat app that helped me to understand how to create models, collections, and views. Towards the end, I even started feeling comfortable changing attributes within JSON blobs and playing around with CSS. Thanks for checking it out!
